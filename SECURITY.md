# Security Policy

This document outlines the security procedures and guidelines for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in this project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a potential security issue, please report it to us responsibly.

**Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been addressed.**

To report a vulnerability, please use one of the following methods:

* **GitHub Issues (Private):** Create a new issue in our repository and clearly mark it as a security vulnerability. We will then convert it to a private security advisory.
* Email us at avrilionis@gmail.com

Please provide as much detail as possible, including:

* A clear description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
* The affected version(s) of the project.
* Potential impact of the vulnerability.
* Your contact information (optional, but appreciated).

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1.  **Receipt:** We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 2 business days.
2.  **Investigation:** We will investigate the reported vulnerability and determine its impact.
3.  **Fix:** If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will develop and release a patch as quickly as possible.
4.  **Disclosure:** Once a patch is released, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability and credit you for the report (if you choose to be credited).
5.  **Coordination:** We will work with you to coordinate the disclosure process and ensure that the vulnerability is properly addressed.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. We ask that you:

* Give us reasonable time to investigate and address the vulnerability before public disclosure.
* Avoid exploiting the vulnerability or accessing sensitive data.
* Provide us with sufficient information to reproduce and fix the vulnerability.
